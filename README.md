# Tic-Tac-Toe Game-Playing Program with MinMax-AB Algorithm

This program implements the Tic-Tac-Toe game using the MinMax-AB algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The program allows you to select different evaluation functions for the computer and the player, and it plays the game in an AI vs. AI mode.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

## Compilation

To compile the program, navigate to the directory containing the source code files and run the following command:

g++ -o tictactoe main.cpp

This will create an executable file named `tictactoe`.

## Usage

To run the program, execute the `tictactoe` executable:

./tictactoe
